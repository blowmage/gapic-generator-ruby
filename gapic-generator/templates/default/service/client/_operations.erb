  # @param credentials [Google::Auth::Credentials, String, Hash,
  #   GRPC::Core::Channel, GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials, Proc]
  #   Provides the means for authenticating requests made by the client. This
  #   parameter can be many types.
  #   A `Google::Auth::Credentials` uses a the properties of its represented
  #   keyfile for authenticating requests made by this client.
  #   A `String` will be treated as the path to the keyfile to be used for the
  #   construction of credentials for this client.
  #   A `Hash` will be treated as the contents of a keyfile to be used for the
  #   construction of credentials for this client.
  #   A `GRPC::Core::Channel` will be used to make calls through.
  #   A `GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials` for the setting up the RPC client. The
  #   channel credentials should already be composed with a
  #   `GRPC::Core::CallCredentials` object.
  #   A `Proc` will be used as an updater_proc for the Grpc channel. The proc
  #   transforms the metadata for requests, generally, to give OAuth credentials.
  # @param config [Google::Gax::Configuration]
  #   The configuration object to use in place of the default configuration. It is
  #   preferable to configure the default configuration using the
  #   {<%= service.client_name %>.configure} method or by passing a block instead. Optional.
  #
  #   The configuration is set to the derived mode, meaning that values can be changed,
  #   but structural changes (adding new fields, etc.) are not allowed. Structural changes
  #   should be made on {<%= service.client_name %>.configure}.
  #
  # @yield [config] Configure the <%= service.client_name %> client.
  # @yieldparam config [Google::Gax::Configuration]
